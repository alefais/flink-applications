# flink-applications

This repository contains a collection of applications implemented with [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) and adapted to be executed on [Apache Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/) by means of the [Storm Compatibility API](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/dev/libs/storm_compatibility.html).

Applications can be run in local mode, further information can be found in each application README and in the [official documentation](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/tutorials/local_setup.html).

The applications implemented with Storm are contained in the [storm-applications repo](https://github.com/alefais/storm-applications).
